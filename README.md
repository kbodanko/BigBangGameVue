**The heart of the project:** Vue js

**Project describe:** Known game 'rock, paper, scissors' enriched with variations from the series 'Big Bang Theory' (Sheldon's version of game). Contains additional elements like lizard and Spock:) This is my first project in **Vue js**. I used a https://wiredjs.com/ library to give the impression of a little sloppy style. Only desktop view. Rules are described on the page. Play with Sheldon!

**Project objective:** To design and code a cool, funny game based on one of my favorite series by myself.

**I learned and/or practised while writing the project:** 
- Use Vue js
- Logical thinking while creating the rules
- Functions and conditional statements
